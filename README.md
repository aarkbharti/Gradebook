# GradeBook Analyzer

- This project is developed for the course **Programming for Problem Solving using Python**.  
- The aim is to build a simple GradeBook Analyzer that reads student marks, processes them, and displays results in a structured format.  
- The program supports both **manual data entry** and **CSV file import**.  
- It performs basic statistical calculations such as **average**, **median**, **highest score**, and **lowest score**.  
- Grades (A, B, C, D, F) are assigned based on mark ranges, and a summary of grade distribution is generated.  
- A **pass/fail list** is created using list comprehension, as required by the assignment.  
- The final output includes a clean, formatted table of student names, marks, and grades.  
- The script also includes a simple **menu-driven loop** that allows users to run the analysis multiple times.  
- Technologies and concepts used include Python 3, dictionaries, functions, loops, conditional statements, CSV handling, and formatted printing.  
- Through this project, I learned how to structure code into modules, read external data from CSV files, work with dictionaries effectively, use list comprehensions, and create user-friendly CLI programs.  
- To run the project, ensure Python 3 is installed, place `gradebook.py` in a folder (along with a CSV file if needed), and execute the program using `python gradebook.py`.  
- Overall, this project helped me apply core Python concepts to a practical scenario and improved my understanding of writing clean, beginner-friendly code suitable for a first-year engineering assignment.
